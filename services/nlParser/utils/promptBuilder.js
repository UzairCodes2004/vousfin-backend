 *  - Strict responseSchema enforcement via generationConfig (prevents hallucination).
 *  - Pakistani accounting terminology (PKR, WHT, EOBI, FBR) is supported.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no code fences, no explanations.
2. NEVER fabricate amounts, dates, or account names not in the input.
3. NEVER hallucinate accounting entries.
4. If information is missing, set the field to null and lower confidence score.
5. Be deterministic — same input must always produce same output.
6. For INSTALLMENT / EMI / financing transactions: isInstallment = true, credit account = liability (not cash).
7. For ADVANCE PAYMENTS from customers: transactionType = "advance_revenue", credit account = "Unearned Revenue".
8. For PREPAID EXPENSES (insurance, rent paid in advance): transactionType = "prepaid_expense", debit = "Prepaid Expenses".
9. For PAYROLL entries: transactionType = "payroll_with_tax" or "salary".
10. For ASSET PURCHASES ON CREDIT/INSTALLMENT: transactionType = "financed_asset_purchase", credit = loan/payable account.
11. For ACCRUED EXPENSES (incurred but not yet paid): transactionType = "accrual_expense", credit = "Accrued Expenses".
12. For ACCRUED INCOME (earned but not yet received): transactionType = "accrual_income", debit = "Accounts Receivable".
13. For INVENTORY SALES: transactionType = "inventory_sale"; debit = cash/bank, credit = "Sales". Also set costAmount if cost of goods is mentioned.
14. For RENT WITH WHT DEDUCTION: transactionType = "wht_on_rent"; set taxAmount = WHT withheld.
15. For SERVICE FEES WITH WHT DEDUCTION: transactionType = "wht_on_services"; set taxAmount = WHT withheld.
16. ALWAYS provide specific debitAccount and creditAccount — use exact account names from the AVAILABLE ACCOUNTS list above. This overrides static template fallbacks and ensures correct accounting.
17. For PROFESSIONAL/LEGAL FEES: transactionType = "expense", subcategory = "legal_fees" or "professional_services", debitAccount = "Professional Fees".
18. For PURCHASED INVENTORY ON CREDIT: transactionType = "inventory_purchase", creditAccount = "Accounts Payable".
19. For GST-EXCLUSIVE PURCHASES ("plus GST", "excluding GST", "+ 17% GST"): transactionType = "gst_exclusive_purchase", isTaxExclusive = true, amount = NET amount, taxRate = rate%, taxType = "GST" (or "SRB"/"PRA" for provincial).
20. For GST-EXCLUSIVE SALES ("plus GST", "excluding tax", "net price"): transactionType = "gst_exclusive_sale", isTaxExclusive = true, amount = NET amount.
21. For GST-INCLUSIVE SALES ("including GST", "with tax", "inc. GST"): transactionType = "gst_inclusive_sale", isTaxInclusive = true, amount = GROSS total.
22. For CUSTOMER RETURNS (returns, refunds, goods returned BY customer): transactionType = "sales_return".
23. For SUPPLIER RETURNS (goods returned TO supplier): transactionType = "purchase_return".
24. For STOCK ADJUSTMENTS (write-off, shrinkage, damage, expiry): transactionType = "inventory_adjustment", adjustmentType = "write_down". For stock found / upward revaluation: adjustmentType = "write_up".
25. For PAYROLL ACCRUAL (recording wages owed but not yet paid): transactionType = "payroll_payable".
26. For PAYING WAGES (settling wages payable): transactionType = "payroll_payment".
27. For GST/WHT FILING to FBR/SRB/PRA: transactionType = "tax_payable_payment", taxType = "GST"/"WHT"/"SRB".

- Extract downPayment when phrases like "5000 down", "with 5000 down payment", "10% down" are present
- Extract interestRate as a percentage when phrases like "at 12%", "12% interest", "12% p.a." are present
- Extract firstPaymentDate when phrases like "first payment due Jan 15", "starting next month", "first EMI on 2026-02-01" appear
- Set interestMethod = "flat" when "simple interest" / "flat interest" is mentioned; otherwise default to "reducing_balance"

- "lakh" = 100000, "lac" = 100000, "k" = 1000, "crore" = 10000000
